New ways of learning, characterised by personalisation, engagement, use of digital media, collaboration, bottom-up practices and where the learner or teacher is a creator of learning content are emerging, facilitated by the exponential growth in OER available via the internet. Europe should exploit the potential of OER much more than is currently the case. This requires good computer skills, but some Member States are still lagging behind as seen in the Education and Training Monitor 2012, with 9 Member States with over 50% of 16-74 year olds with no or low computer skills. While the use of ICT in education and training has been high on the policy agenda, critical elements are not in place to enable digital learning and OER to be mainstreamed across all education and training sectors.
